This directory contains the LOD update files for every Barracuda 7200.11 model. There are two platforms that this series uses, being Brinks and Moose.

You **DO NOT** need a firmware update if:

- you already have a Brinks drive, i.e. ST31500341AS, that is on firmware SD1A/CC1H or later (later versions such as CC4G and SD1B);
- you already have a Moose drive, i.e. ST3500320AS or ST31000340AS, that is on an SDxA firmware version or later. The use of "x" is necessary because four differentfirmware branches exist which all end at an SDxA version.

# What is my drive's firmware branch?

For Moose drives, you'll usually want to pay attention to the first three or four characters of the firmware version:
- If the firmware version is either SD1x, SD81, or AD14, you'll want to use SD1A.
- If the firmware version is SD2x, you'll want to use SD2A.
- If the firmware version is SD3x, you'll want to use SD3A.
- If the firmware version is SD4x, you'll want to use SD4A.
